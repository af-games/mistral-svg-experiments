```

We've set up an SVG canvas with a viewBox that gives us a work area of 100 units wide and tall, centered at the origin (0,0).

**Step 2: Begin drawing tentative lines and shapes using <path> elements**

Let's start by drawing the basic body shape of our dinosaur. We'll use `<path>` elements with `d` attribute to define the movements of a pen that draws the lines.

```svg
<path d="M -40,-30 H 40 V 30 Q 20,50 0,30 Q -20,50 -40,-30"/>
```

We've created a quadrilateral (Q) for the body with control points at (20,50) and (-20,50), and endpoints at (-40,-30) and (40,30).

**Step 3: Discover new features**

Now let's add some legs. We'll use `<rect>` elements to create simple rectangular shapes for the legs.

```svg
<rect x="-60" y="10" width="20" height="80"/>
<rect x="40" y="10" width="20" height="80"/>
```

We've added two rectangles for the legs, one at (-60,10) and another at (40,10), each with a width of 20 units and a height of 80 units.

**Step 4: Document your journey**

Let's add some details to our map by adding circles for the hips and head.

```svg
<circle cx="-20" cy="35" r="15"/>
<circle cx="0" cy="60" r="20"/>
```

We've added two circles, one at (-20,35) with a radius of 15 units for the hip, and another at (0,60) with a radius of 20 units for the head.

**Step 5: Write out your map's final draft**

Finally, let's close our SVG map by adding closing tags.
