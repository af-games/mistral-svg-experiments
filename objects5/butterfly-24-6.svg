<svg>` tag and set up some initial properties:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"
     viewBox="-50 -50 100 100"
     preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet">
```

Here's what we've done so far:

- `<svg>`: This is the root element of an SVG document.
- `xmlns`: This attribute specifies the XML namespace for the SVG graphics.
- `version`: Specifies the version of SVG being used (in this case, 1.1).
- `viewBox`: Defines the aspect ratio and coordinate system of the SVG canvas. Here, we've set it to a square with width and height of 100 units, with its center at the origin (0, 0).
- `preserveAspectRatio`: Ensures that the aspect ratio of the SVG content is preserved during rendering.

Now, let's add some color and shapes in our next "notes":

```xml
<rect x="-50" y="-50" width="100" height="100"
      fill="gold" stroke="black"/>
```

We've added a rectangle that fills the entire viewBox:

- `<rect>`: This element defines a rectangle.
- `x` and `y`: These attributes specify the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle.
- `width` and `height`: These define the dimensions of the rectangle.
- `fill`: This attribute sets the interior color of the shape to gold.
- `stroke`: This attribute sets the border color of the shape to black.

This is just the beginning. We'll continue building our SVG symphony by adding more shapes, colors, and positions for our butterfly masterpiece. Stay tuned!</svg>
