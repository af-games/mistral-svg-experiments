Now, let's start drawing the basic body shape of our dinosaur. We'll use a `<path>` element for this, with a tentative line starting from the top left corner and curving downwards to form the neck:

```svg
<path d="M10 10 Q50 90, 100 50" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
```

Here, `M` stands for move-to (move the pen to this point without drawing), `Q` is a quadratic BÃ©zier curve command (draw a curve from the current point to the control point and then to the endpoint), and the coordinates are given in pixels.

Next, let's add a circle for the head. We'll use a `<circle>` element with its center at `(150, 30)` and radius `30`:

```svg
<circle cx="150" cy="30" r="30" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
```

Now, let's draw the body. We'll use a `<rect>` element for this, with its top left corner at `(100, 50)` and width `70` and height `80`:

```svg
<rect x="100" y="50" width="70" height="80" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
```

As we venture deeper into this new land, we discover more features like limbs. Let's add a tentatively drawn left arm using another `<path>` element:

```svg
<path d="M120 50 Q90 70, 100 80" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
```

Remember to document your journey with detailed notes (attribute values) for each discovery. Here are some attributes we've used so far:

- `stroke`: The color of the outline of the shape.
- `fill`: The color inside the shape. We're using "transparent" here because we want to see our canvas through these shapes.
- `d`: A list of commands and coordinates for `<path>` elements.
- `cx`, `cy`: The x and y coordinates of the center of a `<circle>`.
- `r`: The radius of a `<circle>`.
- `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`: The top left corner's coordinates and dimensions of a `<rect>`.

Finally, let's write out our map's final draft. We'll close the SVG element to signify the end of our journey:
