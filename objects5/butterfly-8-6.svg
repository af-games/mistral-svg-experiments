<svg>` tag and set up some initial attributes:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"
     viewBox="-50 -50 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet">
```

In this opening stanza, we've defined the following:

- `xmlns`: The namespace for SVG.
- `version`: The version of SVG we're using.
- `viewBox`: The aspect ratio and coordinate system bounds. Here, we've set it to cover a square area from `-50` to `50` along both axes.
- `preserveAspectRatio`: This ensures that the aspect ratio is maintained when scaling.

Next, we'll start adding shapes, colors, and positions to bring life to our SVG canvas. Stay tuned for the next notes in this visual melody!</svg>
