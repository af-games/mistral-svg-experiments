<svg>` tag and set up some initial properties:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"
     viewBox="-50 -50 100 100"
     preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet">
```

In this opening stanza, we've defined:
- The namespace for SVG (which is required)
- The version of SVG to use
- A viewBox that sets up a coordinate system suitable for our butterfly masterpiece
- PreserveAspectRatio to maintain the aspect ratio of the elements within the viewBox

Next, let's create an empty `<g>` tag to group our elements together. We'll give this group a transformation so we can position it in the center:

```xml
<g transform="translate(50, 50)">
```

Now, we're ready to start composing individual lines (shapes) of SVG code for our butterfly. Let's begin with the body using an ellipse:

```xml
<ellipse cx="0" cy="0" rx="30" ry="15"
         fill="gold" stroke="black"/>
```

In this line, we've created:
- An ellipse centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 30 along the x-axis and 15 along the y-axis
- Set the fill color to gold and the stroke color to black

We'll continue building our SVG symphony one note (line of code) at a time until we've created a beautiful butterfly masterpiece. Stay tuned for more notes!</svg>
