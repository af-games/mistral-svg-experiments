Next, let's plant some seeds. We'll start with simple shapes like circles for the head and body, and rectangles for the legs:

```svg
<circle cx="50" cy="100" r="40" fill="brown"/>
<rect x="30" y="150" width="90" height="70" rx="20" ry="20" fill="grey"/>
```

Now, let's water and nurture these seeds with some transforms:

```svg
<!-- Head -->
<circle cx="50" cy="100" r="40" fill="brown">
  <animateTransform attributeName="cx" from="50" to="70" type="translate" begin="0s" dur="2s"/>
</circle>

<!-- Body -->
<rect x="30" y="150" width="90" height="70" rx="20" ry="20" fill="grey">
  <animateTransform attributeName="x" from="30" to="40" type="translate" begin="0s" dur="2s"/>
</rect>

<!-- Left leg -->
<rect x="50" y="220" width="20" height="70" rx="10" ry="10" fill="grey">
  <animateTransform attributeName="x" from="50" to="40" type="translate" begin="0s" dur="2s"/>
</rect>

<!-- Right leg -->
<rect x="80" y="220" width="20" height="70" rx="10" ry="10" fill="grey">
  <animateTransform attributeName="x" from="80" to="90" type="translate" begin="0s" dur="2s"/>
</rect>
```

After these animations complete, we'll have our dinosaur in its final form. However, since this is a static representation, we won't actually see the animation. But if you save this as an .svg file and open it in a browser that supports SVG animations (like Chrome or Firefox), you should see the dinosaur "growing".

Finally, let's close our svg tag:
